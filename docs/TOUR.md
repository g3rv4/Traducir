# Welcome to traducir.win

traducir.win is web application project to help Stack Exchange sites communties to translate their sites from English to their language. With your help, we work together to have a Stack Exchange site completely in the community language all the time.

*We are bit different from other sites. Here is how we work:*

1. Use your Stack Exchange site as usual 

> Note: At this time we only support Stack Overflow en Espa√±ol.

2. When you find a string in English on your Stack Exchange site:

   1. Search for that string on https://traducir.win.
   2. Click on the matched string.
   3. Click on "Mark as urgent", even if you will not translate it inmediately.
   4. [optional] Write your translation suggestion.
   5. Submit your changes.
   
3. A reviewer will check the translation suggestions
4. traducir.win will send all the approve suggestions to Transifex.
4. The Community Manager approve the string translations
5. Once a new build is created the string translations will be available on your Stack Exchange site
